# Java Coursework

Whilst at the University of Birmingham doing my Msc in Computer Science,
we were required to do exercises every week to create more complex projects.

Rather than just leave those exercises dusty in my Google Drive, I've decided
to upload them so you can see how I code; my commenting style, my experience
with testing applications, as well as my level of experience, ability, talent etc.

In particular, the code for my Sudoku program is quite complex, so hopefully
you can see that I have talent/experience coding in Java.

## Getting Started

Each directory is it's own separate project, including all the code needed to
compile the Java files, as well as tests for the code when warranted.

So, to run the code;
* Navigate using "cd" to the correct directory
* Compile code; i.e. "javac filename.java"
* Run code; i.e. "java filename"
